# 🧠 Simon Game

A classic memory and sequence-following game implemented using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**. Test your concentration and reaction time!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

The Simon Game challenges players to remember an increasingly long sequence of colors.

1.  **Start:** Press any key on the keyboard to start the game.
2.  **Sequence:** Simon will flash a color and play a corresponding sound.
3.  **Repeat:** You must click the button with the same color.
4.  **Advance:** Simon will add another color to the sequence, making it longer.
5.  **Challenge:** Continue repeating the longer sequence until you make a mistake.
6.  **Game Over:** If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and your final score (level) is displayed. Press any key to restart and try to beat your high score!

* **Intuitive Interface:** Clear visual cues (color flashes) and auditory feedback (sounds).
* **Level Tracking:** Displays the current level/score as the sequence progresses.
* **Game Over State:** Provides clear feedback when the game ends and allows for an easy restart.
